## Week 4 Assignment

## 1. Difference between http and https

### `Answer:`
    HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) uses TCP(Transmission Control Protocol) generally over port 80 to send and receive data packets over the web. Simply it is a protocol that's used by a client and server which allows you to communicate with other websites.

    HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) als uses TCP(Transmission Control Protocol) to send and receive data packets, but it does so over port 433, within a connection encrypted by Transport Layer Security(TLS).

## 2. Http methods

### `Answer:`
    a. GET: retrieve information
    b. POST: submit data to the server
    c. PUT: save an object at the location
    d. DELETE: delete an object at the location

## 3. API

### `Answer:`
    An application programming interface (API) was originally understood to be an application specific computing interface to allow third parties to extend the functionality of that software application beyond its capabilities as they exist out of the box. Such extensions still operated within the confines of that software application.
    
    In building applications, an API (application programming interface) simplifies programming by abstracting the underlying implementation and only exposing objects or actions the developer needs. While a graphical interface for an email client might provide a user with a button that performs all the steps for fetching and highlighting new emails, an API for file input/output might give the developer a function that copies a file from one location to another without requiring that the developer understand the file system operations occurring behind the scenes

## 4. Difference between SOAP and REST API

### `Answer:`
    REST APIs are tThose application programming interfaces that are backed by the architectural style of REST architectural systems. REST is basically an architectural style of the web services that work as a channel of communication between different computers or systems on the internet. The term REST API is something else.

    SOAP is a standard communication protocol system that permits processes using different operating systems like Linux and Windows to communicate via HTTP and its XML. SOAP based APIs are designed to create, recover, update and delete records like accounts, passwords, leads, and custom objects. SOAP APIs take the advantages of making web based protocols such as HTTP and its XML that are already operating the all operating systems that are why its developers can easily manipulate web services and get responses without caring about language and platforms at all.

    Differences:
        a.  REST API has no has no official standard at all because it is an architectural style. SOAP API, on the other      hand, has an official standard because it is a protocol.
        b.  REST APIs uses multiple standards like HTTP, JSON, URL, and XML while SOAP APIs is largely based on HTTP and      XML.
        c.  As REST API deploys multiple standards, so it takes fewer resources and bandwidth as compared to SOAP that        uses XML for the creation of Payload and results in the large sized file.



## 5. JSON

### `Answer:`
    JSON(Javascript Object Notation) is an open standard file format, and data interchange format, that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data objects consisting of attributeâ€“value pairs and array data types (or any other serializable value).
